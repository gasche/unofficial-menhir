  (* In the code-based back-end, the [run] function is sometimes responsible
     for pushing a new cell on the stack. This is motivated by code sharing
     concerns. In this interpreter, there is no such concern; [run]'s caller
     is always responsible for updating the stack. *)

  (* In the code-based back-end, there is a [run] function for each state
     [s]. This function can behave in two slightly different ways, depending
     on when it is invoked, or (equivalently) depending on [s].

     If [run] is invoked after shifting a terminal symbol (or, equivalently,
     if [s] has a terminal incoming symbol), then [run] discards a token,
     unless [s] has a default reduction on [#]. (Indeed, in that case,
     requesting the next token might drive the lexer off the end of the input
     stream.)

     If, on the other hand, [run] is invoked after performing a goto transition,
     or invoked directly by an entry point, then there is nothing to discard.

     These two cases are reflected in [CodeBackend.gettoken].

     Here, the code is structured in a slightly different way. It is up to
     the caller of [run] to indicate whether to discard a token. *)

       so as to determine which action should be taken. *)

    (* Peeking at the first input token, without taking it off the input
       stream, is normally done by reading [env.token]. However, we check
       [env.shifted] first: if it is -1, then the lookahead token is the
       [error] token. *)
