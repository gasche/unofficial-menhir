(* This module uses Floyd and Warshall's algorithm to detect whether a graph
   with integer-weighted edges contains a simple cycle of negative weight. *)

(* The algorithm runs in cubic time in the number of vertices. It may be
   worthwhile to first use Tarjan's algorithm to obtain the graph's strongly
   connected components, and use Floyd and Warshall's algorithm only on each
   component. *)
