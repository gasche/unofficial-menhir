This HOWTO is intended for new Menhir developers, and should explain how
things work.

For the moment, there is not much information in it.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

There are two ways of building Menhir: either from scratch, or incrementally.

Building from scratch is performed via the public Makefile, and requires
defining the PREFIX variable, even if no installation is performed:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local -f Makefile

This is a two-stage process, in which a first version of menhir is built
using ocamlyacc, and a second version of menhir is built using the menhir
executable produced by the first stage.

Building incrementally is useful when working on the code. In that case,
one wishes to recompile incrementally, without going through the bootstrap
process. This works only if a menhir executable already exists in the src/
subdirectory. This is done simply by typing:

  make

(or, equivalently, make -f GNUmakefile).
